            <p class="bio">I am <b>Dhruv Rai</b>, a second-year undergrad student pursuing bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering with
                Specialisation in Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) at <b>Netaji Subhas University of Technology</b>, Delhi.
I was born and brought up in Delhi. I have done my schooling from
<b>Vidya Jain Public School</b>, Delhi.
I love watching thriller-suspense movies and shows. I also like to
binge American animated sitcoms. I’m really keen on cricket and I
relax by listening to music and podcasts.
I like to take up challenges and think to accept both success and
failure in a balanced way to move forward. 
<p class="bio">
My short-term goal is to
achieve excellence in some soft skills and my long-term goal is to
prepare myself to be recruited in a reputed company expressing my
views in a lot of conversations. So, I am also currently trying to step
out of my comfort zone.

                my ultimate goal.</p>
